### V3.4.3

**Sep 2017**

- Add extra UART header with Rx/Tx swap-over for easy ESP connection
- Increase  reservoir capacitor of AC-DC circuit C18 16uF to 100uF to allow for greater peak power consumption of RFM69CW (compared to RFM12B)
- Change Burden resistors R7, R8, R9 (22R) from 1% to 0.5% tolerance  to increase accuracy. Wanted to change to 0.1% but unable to source
- Changed Burden resistor R18 (120R) from 1 % to 0.1%
- Change all 470K resistors from 1% to 0.1% (R1, R2, R4, R6, R11, R12, R15, R17, R21, R23, R27, R30)
- Changed CT4 jack plug socket to blue colour to indicate low power high accuracy channel
